***Project Overview***

This project involves Extracting, Transforming, and Loading (ETL) data related to global economic and demographic indicators. Utilizing a Jupyter Notebook, the project encompasses a series of Python scripts to handle data from a CSV file, world_development_data.csv, and perform various data analysis and visualization tasks using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, geopandas, seaborn, scipy, networkx, and statsmodels.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
PostgreSQL Database
Required Python Libraries: csv, psycopg2, matplotlib, geopandas, pandas, seaborn, scipy, networkx, statsmodels

**Installation**
Python and Jupyter Notebook:
Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from Python's official website.

**PostgreSQL:**
Install PostgreSQL if it's not already installed. You can find the installation guide on the PostgreSQL official website.

**Python Libraries:**
Install the required Python libraries using pip:
**pip install psycopg2 matplotlib geopandas pandas seaborn scipy networkx statsmodels**

**Database Setup**
Create a PostgreSQL database named lab10.
Set up the required tables as per the schema defined in the Jupyter Notebook.
Update the database connection parameters in the Jupyter Notebook with your PostgreSQL credentials.

**Data Source**
The primary data source is a CSV file named world_development_data.csv.
Ensure the CSV file is located in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook, or update the file path in the notebook accordingly.
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your development environment and execute the cells in sequence. The notebook is divided into various sections, each performing specific ETL tasks:

**Data Loading and Transformation:**
Scripts to load data from the CSV file into the PostgreSQL database, including data cleaning and transformation.

**Data Visualization:**
Various visualization scripts to analyze and represent the data, including line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, choropleth maps, and more.

**Statistical Analysis:**
Includes scripts for linear regression, correlation analysis, and time series decomposition.

**Network Analysis:**
Script to create a network graph representing trade relationships.

**Features**
ETL process for handling complex datasets.
Advanced data visualizations for economic and demographic analysis.
Statistical analysis for predictive insights.
Geographic data representation and network analysis.
